A boost converter is a DC-DC type switching converter that steps up the voltage while maintaining a constant power balance. This  high-efficiency boost converter circuit based on the popular TL494 IC, which has a minimum supply voltage of 7V and a maximum of 40V.This circuit can handle a maximum current of 19Amps,so when we want more Amps we need to change our inductor to biggest one .  This TL494 Boost Converter circuit is made up of components that are very easily obtainable and this circuit can easily handle power more than 100Watts.When we want to  construct this circuit in handmade PCB , we must  reinforce the PCB traces with a thick layer of solder to lower the trace resistance and we need to attach a heatsink to the mosfet.
